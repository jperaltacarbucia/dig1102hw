Assignment operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The basic assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.  The other assignment operators are shorthand for the operations listed in the following table:

Operator	    Meaning
x += y	        x = x + y
x -= y	        x = x - y
x *= y	        x = x * y
x /= y	        x = x / y
x %= y	        x = x % y
x <<= y	        x = x << y
x >>= y	        x = x >> y
x >>>= y	    x = x >>> y
x &= y	        x = x & y
x ^= y      	x = x ^ y
x |= y	        x = x | y
