/**
 * Retrospective:
 * 
 * What did we do well?
 *   > Followed our test plan...!
 *   > Commit per pair
 *   - Baby steps at first...
 *   - Enforced test runs!
 * 
 * What would we like to improve?
 *   > More consistent coding style:
 *     - assert() vs assert.equal()
 *     - whitespace around arguments
 *     - comparisons: == vs ===
 *     - messages: '1 + 1 equals 2' vs '1 and 1 is 2'
 *   - More baby steps...?
 *   > Refactor earlier to reduce typing:
 *     - before moving to another operator?
 *     - after doing something repetitively
 *     - reduce repetition and possible errors
 *     - Started to refactor at the end...  //http://www.slideshare.net/szafranek/javascript-refactoring
 *     - Start with division!
 * 
 * Did we meet our goals? Why?
 *   - Slowed down and learned a lot:
 *     - "git commit -a" to commit all dirty files
 *     - "git checkout" to get back to a saved state
 *     - refactoring!
 *   - Everyone got a turn at pilot/copilot...!
 *   - Did not fulfill specification:
 *     - No full tests on subtraction()
 *     - No tests or code on multiplication() or division()
 *     - No tests to cover "DIV BY ZERO"
